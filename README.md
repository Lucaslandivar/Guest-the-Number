<h2>Description of the project</h2>
<p>I make my first project in Node.js and my first project of Back-end. This project is simple but help me to understand and practice the things i have been learning about Node.js, where i learn about install a module and use chark and log things in the terminal.</p> 

<h2>Why i make this project?</h2>
<p>I make this project so i can learn and practice Node.js in a fun way.</p>

<h2>How does this project work?</h2>
<P>In the terminal (where the game logs), there will be 3 options of tree different difficulties for the game: <br>The easiest mode:</br> the user have to guess a number between 1 to 10.<br>The medium mode:</br> the user have to guess a number between 1 to 50. <br>The hardest mode:</br> the user have to gess a number between 1 to 100. If the number is too high or to low, there will be a message for the user to help him guess the number. Once the user has hit the number, the number of attemps it takes will appear bellow the game.</p>

<h2>How can i use this project?</h2>
<p><b>First step:</b> In your terminal, write "npm init -y" to made a quick set up. Then install the packages:<b>chalk</b> and <b>readline-sync</b> by writing this "npm i chalk readline-sync". Go to the package.json and write <b>"type": "module"</b></p>
<p><b>Second step:</b> You can copy and paste the script in your index.js</p>
<p><b>Third step:</b> In the terminal of your file in wich the game will be executed, write "node .\index.js" to iniciate the game.</p>
<p><b>Fourth step:</b> To play this game you have to choose the difficult (between 1 to 3), write it and press the "Enter", then you will start playing.</p>
<p>I suggest to take a look of my code if you canÂ´t or have a trouble running the game.</p>
